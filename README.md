# Visual Studio Code

My Visual Studio Code configs.

## Do it

Make sure that `code` is in your `$PATH`. Clone to appropriate path and cd:

```sh
Library/Application\ Support/Code/User # Mac
```

Install the extensions:

```sh
./vsync install
```

If you add/remove extensions:

```sh
./vsync update
git add .
git commit # you get the gist
```
